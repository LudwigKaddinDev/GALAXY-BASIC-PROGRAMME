# GALAXY-BASIC-PROGRAMME
Basic Python programme used for calculating ship costs and maintaining your inventory.

The current version includes full ship cost and inventory saving.
UPDATE: 26/06/19: This README will be updated later on this week. A lot more features have been added.

This programme is for the ROBLOX game of GALAXY. 
It can be used to calculate how many materials you still need for a new ship, based on USER input. 
You can also use it to keep track of your materials mined (and skip ship cost calculation all together). 

If more materials need to be included (for more advanced players for example), DM me: Ludwig#0350.
All project files, including Visual Studio Solution, have been added to this repository.
