# GALAXY-BASIC-PROGRAMME
Basic Python programme used for calculating ship costs and maintaining your inventory.

THE CURRENT VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE SAVING! ONCE YOU CLOSE THE PROGRAM YOU NEED TO RE-ENTER ALL VALUES. ITS BASED ON USER INPUT. 
THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

This programme is for the ROBLOX game of GALAXY. 
It can be used to calculate how many materials you still need for a new ship, based on USER input. 
You can also use it to keep track of your materials mined (and skip ship cost calculation all together). 

If more materials need to be included (for more advanced players for example), DM me: Ludwig#0350.
All project files, including Visual Studio Solution, have been added to this repository.
